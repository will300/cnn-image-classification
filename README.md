# cnn-image-classification

The notebooks in this repository each contain a convolutional neural network for image classification using a different data set. They are each built using Tensorflow. I wrote these notebooks to put into practice what I learned on the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree programme, and to gain experience in building CNNs for my masters project.
