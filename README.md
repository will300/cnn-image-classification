# cnn-image-classification

The notebooks in this repository each contain a convolutional neural network for image classification using a different data set. They are each built using Tensorflow. I wrote these notebooks to put into practice what I learned on the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree programme, and to gain experience in building CNNs for my masters project.

## datasets

MNIST hand-written digits, downloaded automatically in the notebook.

CIFAR-10 low-resolution images, found [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). To be able to use these, download the zip file file for Python and unzip the individual train and test folders within the same directory as the notebook.

## modules

Tensorflow 1.12.0; Numpy 1.16.0; Matplotlib 3.0.2, Keras 2.2.0
